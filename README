This is a KD tree implementation, written in C, meant as an extension for Python.

Currently it is hardcoded for two dimensions; the interested user can either puzzle
out how to extend it or wait until I am motivated to add more dimensions.
I took my inspiration from http://code.google.com/p/python-kdtree/ and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree, so those might be a good start.

This is my first C extension to Python, so there may be something I've done incredibly
wrong-please email me if you discover a bug.  I've tested this against a 100K node tree,
so I don't believe there are any obvious bugs such as neglecting to INCREF or DECREF,
but I can't be sure.
