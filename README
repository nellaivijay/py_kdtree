This is a KD tree implementation, written in C, meant as an extension for Python.

It is mostly meant as an example for:
1. How to hand-write a Python wrapper for C (top level directory).
2. How to wrap C code in Python using Cython (cython_with_c directory).
3. How to generate C code with just Cython (cython_wrapper directory).

The KD-tree implementation itself is sort of a side issue; it works, but it is missing
features like adding nodes.  The reason for bothering to write this in Cython/C is that
a pure Python implementation is slow.  On a sample run (with the file in Linux's cache),
it takes 12 minutes to search for 3 nearest neighbors on a
100,000 node tree using pure Python.  The implementations for (2) and (3) take 1.8 and 
3.3 seconds, which is a significant speed increase.

Currently it is hardcoded for two dimensions.  I am working on adding multiple dimensions
to (2) and (3), as well as unifying the API and making it easier to use.
I took my inspiration from http://code.google.com/p/python-kdtree/ and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree, so those might be a good start.

This is my first C extension to Python, so there may be something I've done incredibly
wrong-please email me if you discover a bug.  I've tested this against several trees,
from 10 nodes to 100,000 nodes, so I don't believe there are any obvious bugs such as 
neglecting to INCREF or DECREF, but I can't be sure.
